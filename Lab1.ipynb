    "The learning outcomes of this session are\n",
    "\n",
    "-   to have an introductory understanding of Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   To have an introductory understanding of the library NumPy,\n",
    "    particularly with respect to vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   To examine a case where vectors can be analysed that have a much\n",
    "    larger dimension than 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks\n",
    "=========\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven’t encountered this before this is an example of a notebook\n",
    "(specifically a Jupyter notebook). This brings together text and code\n",
    "into one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parts of this screen which have \"In \\[ \\]:\" to the left are referred\n",
    "to as cells. Cells are pieces of code that can be run. You can run the\n",
    "cells by clicking on the cell and pressing Control + Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the cell generates output it will appear immediately after the cell\n",
    "in question when you do this.\n",

    "Do not just click through all the cells without thinking about what each\n",
    "cell is going to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There will be cells that are empty - you will need to fill them!**\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to note that the cells are in order and you should enter\n",
    "them in that order.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section, you will be largely running things interactively but\n",
    "it’s best to set up an editor window, type in there and then run the\n",
    "script (The F5 key will very much be your friend here).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you click on Help and Keyboard Shortcuts you will get a list of\n",
    "shortcuts for doing particular operations (I find the one for creating a\n",
    "cell below the one you are using is very useful).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to save your notebook you can click on the diskette icon but\n",
    "remember that if you restart your binder session the information will be\n",
    "lost. To keep a permanent version on your machine, click on File and\n",
    "then Download as and then Notebook. When you restart your binder session\n",
    "on the directory page select Upload and then upload your file. You can\n",
    "then run it from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/\" class=\"uri\">Google Colab</a> for this exercise. You will need to use the tab on \n",
    "the left hand side to load the data files which you can download from the github repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run Jupyter directly from the department server, (download the repository and type jupyter notebook from the command line). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can also run Jupyter from your own computer. Instructions on\n",
