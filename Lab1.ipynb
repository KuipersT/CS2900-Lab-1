This brings together text and code\ninto one place.\n\nThe parts of this screen which have \"In \\[ \\]:\" to the left are referred\nto as cells. Cells are pieces of code that can be run. You can run the\ncells by clicking on the cell and pressing Control + Enter.\n\nIf the cell generates output it will appear immediately after the cell\nin question when you do this.\n\nDo not just click through all the cells without thinking about what each\ncell is going to do.\n\n**There will be cells that are empty - you will need to fill them!**\n\nIt’s important to note that the cells are in order and you should enter\nthem in that order.\n\nFor this section, you will be largely running things interactively but\nit’s best to set up an editor window, type in there and then run the\nscript (The F5 key will very much be your friend here).\n\nIf you click on Help and Keyboard Shortcuts you will get a list of\nshortcuts for doing particular operations (I find the one for creating a\ncell below the one you are using is very useful).\n\nIf you want to save your notebook you can click on the diskette icon but\nremember that if you restart your binder session the information will be\nlost. To keep a permanent version on your machine, click on File and\nthen Download as and then Notebook. When you restart your binder session\non the directory page select Upload and then upload your file. You can\nthen run it from there.\n\nYou can also use <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/\" class=\"uri\">Google Colab</a> for this exercise. You will need to use the tab on \nthe left hand side to load the data files which you can download from the github repo.\n\nYou can run Jupyter directly from the department server, (download the repository and type jupyter notebook from the command line). \n\nFinally, you can also run Jupyter from your own computer.

It turns out that these frequencies are surprisingly\nconstant between different texts taken from the same language. We can\neven use it to decrypt texts.\n\nPut more mathematically for each text $\\mathcal T$ we can compute the\nfrequency of each letter $f_a^{\\mathcal T}$, $f_b^{\\mathcal T}$ ,\n$\\dots$ where $f_a^{\\mathcal T}$ is the frequency of lower case “a”’s in\n$\\mathcal T$ and so on. For the English alphabet there are 26 letters,\nso we can construct a vector $\\underline{f}^{\\mathcal T}$ of those\nfrequencies. So, $\\underline{f}^{\\mathcal T}$ is a vector *with 26\nentries*.\n\nWe can then compare how similar two texts $A$ and $B$ are by comparing\ntheir frequencies. Let’s suppose that their corresponding frequency\nvectors are $\\underline{f}^A$ and $\\underline{f}^B$. We can easily\ncompute cosine of the angle between these two vectors by computing\n$$\\cos \\theta \\;\\; = \\;\\; \\frac{{\\underline{f^A}^\\intercal} \\cdot {\\underline{f^B}}}{|\\underline{f^A}||\\underline{f^B}|} \\;\\; .$$\n\nRemember -\n\n1.  if $\\cos \\theta = 1$ then $\\underline{f}^A$ and $\\underline{f}^B$\n    are parallel to each other, which indicates their frequencies are\n    very similar.\n\n2.  It doesn’t matter about the number of dimensions, the above\n    relationship still holds (not just for two or three dimensions).\n\nWe can test this in Python.

Each letter in a text is\nexchanged with a letter that is a specific number down from it in the\nalphabetical sequence. So with a encryption rotation with an offset of\none would exchange\n\n`a` $\\rightarrow$ `b`,\n\n`b` $\\rightarrow$ `c`,\n\n$\\dots$\n\n`z` $\\rightarrow$ `a`.\n\nThe cipher rotation with an offset of 13 (or ROT-13) would be `a`\n$\\rightarrow$ `n` and so on.\n\nIf ones knows the offset, then one can decrypt the text by either\nperforming the reverse transformation on the encrypted text or\nequivalently apply the transformation with a new offset where the sum of\nthe offsets is 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet). So in the\nfirst case if a text has an encryption rotation with a offset of 1\napplied to it and is then followed by an encryption rotation of 25 we\nend up with the same text. Two applications of ROT-13 likewise return\nyou to the same text.\n\nThis encryption method can be very easily broken using the letter\nfrequency method that was discussed in the last set of lab materials. In\nparticular, *the frequencies of the letters will remain the same,\nregardless of how they are transformed*. Furthermore if you have a\nreference text, which you know is from the same language as the\nencrypted text, then you can compare the frequencies to determine what\nwas the offset was.\n\nIf one applies the encryption rotation algorithm with right offset on\nthe encrypted text then the cosine of the angle between the two\nfrequency vectors should be close to 1.\n\nThe following function takes a string and carries out a rotation of a\nstring.\n\n[1] The fact that it’s sometimes called the “Caesar Cipher” gives you an\nidea of how old it is!","metadata":{},"id":"94a9e010"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import sys\n\ndef rot(s,shift):\n    result = \"\"\n    numLetters = 26\n    if ( shift < -(numLetters-1) or shift > (numLetters-1) ):\n        print(\"Error in rot function - shift must be > -25 and < 25\")\n        sys.exit(-1)\n    for v in s:\n        o, c, upper = v, v.lower(), v.isupper()\n        if c >= 'a' and c <= 'z':\n            deltaO = ord(c) - ord('a')\n            deltaN = (deltaO + shift) % numLetters\n            c = chr(ord('a') + deltaN)\n        c = c.upper() if upper else c\n        result += c\n\n    return result","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"1ec4e6ca"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**CHECKPOINT In the Jupyter folder there is a piece of English text\nencrypted using this approach called Englishencrypt.txt Using the above\nfunction try and decrypt the text just by comparing the cosine of the\nfrequency vectors between the rotated text and the reference English.txt\nfile.**","metadata":{},"id":"2b7a0cc6"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"cd1f32f5"}]}
